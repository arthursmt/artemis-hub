You are updating the **New Proposal** flow of the Artemis Hunting MVP React app.

There are two steps now:

1. New Proposal – member data entry (current screen, to be improved).
2. Credit Validation – new screen, shown after successful validation of the form.

Use the current layout and styling as the base and apply the following changes.

---

## 1. Fix the ID Document Type dropdown appearance

On the New Proposal screen, the **ID Document Type** dropdown currently has a transparent dropdown menu which makes the options hard to read.

Update the dropdown styling so that:

- The dropdown **menu background is solid white** (or the app’s main card background color), not transparent.
- The options have clear text color (dark on light) and sufficient contrast.
- The menu has a subtle border and shadow, similar to other popover elements in the design.
- Scrolling and hover states should remain consistent with the app’s existing style.

Do not change the existing options in the list or their labels.

## 2. Split “Client Name” into three fields

Replace the single **Client Name** field with three separate fields, grouped together in a way that keeps the layout clean and not too massive.

Fields:

1. `First Name` (required)
2. `Middle Name (optional)` (this is the **only optional field** on this screen)
3. `Last Name` (required)

UI guidance:

- Place these three fields in a logical layout:
  - For example, two fields on the first row (First Name, Last Name) and Middle Name below,
  - or three fields in a responsive grid that still looks good on a 10.1" tablet.
- The label for the middle name must clearly indicate that it is optional, e.g. `Middle Name (optional)`.

Validation rules for all member name fields:

- **First Name** and **Last Name** are required.
- They accept **only letters and spaces**:
  - No numbers, no special characters.
- They must **not start with spaces**:
  - The first character must be a letter.
- Middle Name follows the same character rules (letters and spaces only) but is optional.

You can implement this with simple input validation (e.g. regex) and show inline error messages under the invalid fields.

## 3. Requested Amount ($) – numeric only, currency mask, and limit

For each member, the **Requested Amount ($)** field must behave as follows:

- Input should accept **only numeric characters** from the user (0–9).
- On the front end, the value should be displayed with a **currency mask** in US dollars:
  - Example: user types `1000000` → the field shows `$ 1,000,000.00`.
- The **maximum allowed value is 50,000**:
  - If the user types a value greater than 50000, the field should:
    - either prevent the value (clamp it) or
    - show a validation error and block submission.
- The field is required and must be **greater than 0**.

You can use a currency formatting helper or library if already used in the project, or implement a simple formatter.

---

## 4. Required fields and validation per member

On this New Proposal screen, **all fields are required for each member**, except `Middle Name`.

For each member tab, the required fields are:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Requested Amount ($)
- ID Document Type
- Document Number

Validation rules:

- All required fields must be filled and valid before advancing to the next step.
- The **ID Document Type** field must only accept values from the dropdown options (no free text).
- The **Document Number** field:
  - is required,
  - is a free text field that can accept any characters (since document formats vary widely),
  - no specific formatting rules are enforced at this stage.

When the user clicks **Create Proposal**:

- Validate **every member** that exists in the group:
  - Each member must have all required fields filled and valid.
- If any member has validation errors:
  - Do **not** proceed to the next screen.
  - Show inline error messages for the invalid fields (for example, under the inputs or as red helper text).
  - Optionally scroll to the first invalid member/field.

Only when all members pass validation should the flow advance to the Credit Validation screen.

## 5. New step: Credit Validation screen

After a successful click on **Create Proposal** on the New Proposal screen:

- Instead of immediately “finishing” the flow, navigate to a new screen called **Credit Validation**.

### 5.1. Routing / state

- You can manage steps with a simple React state like `currentStep = "new_proposal" | "credit_validation"`, or,
- If a router is already used, you can navigate to a new route (e.g. `/credit-validation`).

The important part is:
- **Step 1:** New Proposal (member data input).
- **Step 2:** Credit Validation (reviewing internal/external checks).

### 5.2. Credit Validation screen layout

Create a new screen component, e.g. `CreditValidationScreen`, with:

- Title: `Credit Validation`
- Subtitle: something like `Reviewing internal and external rules before approving this prospect as a client.`

Content:

- A **summary list of all members** included in the proposal:
  - For each member, show:
    - Full name (First + Middle + Last, skipping Middle if empty),
    - Requested Amount (formatted as currency),
    - ID Document Type,
    - Document Number.

- Below or next to each member, show placeholder sections representing the checks being done, for example:
  - `Credit bureau checks`
  - `AML / anti-money-laundering screening`
  - `Internal blacklist / risk criteria`

For now, it is acceptable that these checks are **static or simulated**, e.g.:

- Show each as a list item with a status icon (`Pending`, `Passed`, `Failed`) or just `Pending` placeholders.
- The goal is to represent **that this step exists in the flow**, even if no real external integration is implemented yet.

Add a simple **“Back”** action (to return to the New Proposal step) and optionally a **“Continue” / “Approve”** button for future steps (e.g. product configuration, contract signature) – this can be a placeholder for now.

## 6. Behavior recap

- New Proposal screen:
  - Uses member tabs (Member 1, Member 2, etc.) as already implemented.
  - Has split name fields (First, Middle optional, Last).
  - Validates names (letters and spaces only, no leading spaces).
  - Validates Requested Amount as numeric, currency-masked, and <= 50,000.
  - Validates ID Document Type as a selected option from the dropdown.
  - Requires Document Number with no format restrictions.
  - All members must be valid to proceed.

- Create Proposal button:
  - Runs validation on **all members**.
  - If validation passes, sets the appropriate state and navigates to the **Credit Validation** screen.
  - If validation fails, stays on the New Proposal screen and shows errors.

Please implement these changes in the existing codebase, keeping styling and layout consistent with the current Artemis Hunting MVP design and ensuring the form remains clean and usable on a 10.1" Samsung tablet.
