You are fixing the behavior of the **Requested Amount ($)** field on the New Proposal screen.

Right now:
- When the user types a large value (e.g. 5000000), an extra formatted value (e.g. `$50,000.00`) appears BELOW the input.
- The behavior is confusing and looks like the value is being clamped to 50,000.

We want to change this behavior as follows:

---

## 1. Remove the secondary formatted value under the input

- Remove any extra label or text under the Requested Amount field that shows a formatted value (such as `$50,000.00`).
- The **only place** where the amount should appear is inside the input itself.

---

## 2. Format inside the input, not in a separate line

- The formatting to currency must happen **in the input field itself**, not as a separate label.
- Behavior:

  - The user can type numbers freely (including zeros and more than 5 digits).
  - The internal numeric value should be parsed from the digits.
  - When it is appropriate to format (for example, on `blur` or after the user stops typing), display the formatted value in the input as US currency:
    - e.g. `50000` → `$50,000.00`
    - `2500` → `$2,500.00`

- IMPORTANT: Do **not** clamp or automatically change the numeric value to 50,000 when the user types more than that. Keep the actual value the user typed and handle the limit with a validation error (see next section).

Make sure zeros are accepted normally (the user must be able to type values like `50000` without the input jumping to `0.05` or similar).

---

## 3. Enforce the 50,000 max with an error message, not by changing the value

- The **maximum allowed loan amount is 50,000**.
- If the numeric value entered by the user is **greater than 50,000**:

  - Keep the user’s value in the input (formatted as currency).
  - Show a validation error message directly under the input, for example:
    - `Maximum loan amount is $50,000.00`
  - Mark the field as invalid (red border / red helper text as done with other errors).
  - When this error is present, the user **cannot proceed** (the Create Proposal button should not advance to the next screen).

- When the user corrects the value so that it is:
  - greater than 0, and
  - less than or equal to 50,000,

  then:

  - **clear the error message**,
  - restore the normal field styling,
  - allow the form to be submitted.

- The field is still required:
  - If empty or 0, keep using the existing “required” error logic.

---

## 4. Summary

- No more extra formatted “shadow value” below the input.
- The amount is shown only **inside the input**, formatted as currency.
- Values over 50,000 are allowed to be typed but trigger a clear error message:
  - `Maximum loan amount is $50,000.00`
- The error disappears automatically when the value is corrected, and the user cannot advance while the error is active.

Do not change any other fields or validation rules on this screen. Only adjust the Requested Amount field behavior and its validation/error handling as specified above.
