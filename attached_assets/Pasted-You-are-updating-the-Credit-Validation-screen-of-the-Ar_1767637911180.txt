You are updating the **Credit Validation** screen of the Artemis Hunting MVP app.

Keep the existing layout and styling as-is:
- One card per member (with name, ID document, etc.).
- A "VALIDATION CHECKS" section with rows like:
  - Credit bureau checks
  - AML / anti–money–laundering screening
  - Internal blacklist / risk criteria
- A right-hand panel with "Validation in Progress".

Do NOT change the overall structure. Only implement the behaviors and text changes described below.

---

## 1) Show the correct requested amount per member (no more $0.00)

Right now, each member card shows `$0.00` in the top-right corner.

Update this so that:

- The top-right amount for each member shows that member’s **requested loan amount**, formatted as US currency.
- Use the same numeric value that was captured on the New Proposal screen for that member.
  - Example: if Member 1 requested 5,555.55 then display `$5,555.55`.

If this amount is already stored in state (e.g. `member.requestedAmount`), use it here and format it consistently.

---

## 2) Rename the third check label

In the `VALIDATION CHECKS` section:

- Change the text `Internal blacklist / risk criteria` to:

  **`Internal risk criteria`**

Do not use the word “blacklist” anywhere in the UI.

---

## 3) Simulate inline validation with progressive status changes

Because there is no real backend, we want to simulate an inline validation flow using front-end logic.

For each member and each validation check:

### 3.1. Status states

Each check should have one of these states:

- `Pending`
- `Approved`
- `Denied`

Visual ideas (adapt to existing style):

- Pending: yellow text/icon with a clock (as in the current design).
- Approved: green text/icon with a check mark.
- Denied: red text/icon with an “X” or similar.

### 3.2. Initial state

When the Credit Validation screen first loads:

- All checks for all members start as **Pending**.
- The right-hand panel for each member shows:
  - Title: `Validation in Progress`
  - Subtext: e.g. `Automated rules engine is processing this member.`

### 3.3. Simulated async progression

Implement a simple front-end simulation using timers (for example `setTimeout`):

- After a short delay (e.g. 1–3 seconds), update each check from `Pending` to either:
  - `Approved`, or
  - `Denied`.

You can implement logic such as:

- For now, use a simple deterministic or random rule (e.g. approve all checks, or randomly deny one check for some members).
- The key is that the UI **visibly transitions** from `Pending` → `Approved` or `Denied` over time.

For each member, compute an **overall member status** based on the individual checks:

- If **all checks = Approved** → member status = `Approved`.
- If **any check = Denied** → member status = `Denied`.
- If at least one check still Pending and none Denied → member status = `In Progress`.

### 3.4. Right-hand panel messaging

Update the right-hand panel on each member card based on the overall member status:

- If member status = `In Progress`:
  - Title: `Validation in Progress`
  - Subtext: `Automated rules engine is processing this member.` (or similar).

- If member status = `Approved`:
  - Title: `Validation Approved`
  - Subtext: `All checks have been approved for this member.`

- If member status = `Denied`:
  - Title: `Validation Denied`
  - Subtext: `This member did not meet one or more risk criteria.`

Use the word **“Denied”** (not “dennied”).

For checks that are Denied, show a brief description next to the check row, for example:

- `Denied – does not meet internal risk criteria`
- `Denied – credit bureau rules not met`

Avoid using “blacklist” in any of these messages.

---

## 4) Allow removing denied members at this stage

Members who end up with an overall status of **Denied** should be removable in this phase so the agent can proceed with only approved members.

Implement:

- For members with status `Denied`, show a **“Remove member”** action on the card:
  - This can be a button or link, placed in a consistent, visible spot (e.g. near the top-right or bottom-right of the card).
- When the agent clicks “Remove member”:
  - Show a confirmation dialog (similar to the one used in the New Proposal screen), e.g.:
    - `Are you sure you want to remove this member from the proposal?`
  - Only remove the member if the user confirms.
- After removal:
  - The member is removed from the list on this screen.
  - Any subsequent steps should only include the remaining members.

You may enforce that the user cannot move to the next step while there are members with status `Denied`, or require that all denied members be removed first.

## 5) Integration notes

- Keep the screen purely front-end (no real API calls). Use timeouts or simple local logic to simulate async validations and status transitions.
- Make sure the member data (name, ID document, document number, and requested amount) is correctly passed from the New Proposal step into this Credit Validation screen.
- Do not change navigation structure beyond what already exists; just enhance the behavior of this screen.

After these changes:
- Each member will show their real requested amount instead of `$0.00`,
- Validation will appear to run in-line (Pending → Approved/Denied),
- The wording uses “Internal risk criteria” instead of “blacklist”,
- Denied members can be removed at this stage before proceeding.
