You are adding a new **Product Configuration** step to the Artemis Hunting MVP app, after the Credit Validation screen.

This step is a multi-step form per approved member, inside a group loan proposal.

IMPORTANT:
- Reuse the existing design system (cards, typography, buttons).
- Do NOT change the Dashboard, New Proposal, or Credit Validation screens.
- Create a new screen/route (e.g. `/product-config`) that is reached from the "Continue to Product Config" button after all members are approved.

## 1) Overall layout and navigation

### 1.1. Header and group context

Create a simpler header for this Product Config screen:

- No search bar, no notification icons.
- Show:
  - Artemis logo + "HUNTING MVP" (same as other screens, but simpler).
  - Page title: `Product Configuration`.

At the top of the content area, display a **Group summary bar**:

- `Group ID: <auto-generated-id>`
- `Leader: <leader full name>`

About Group ID:

- When entering this Product Config step **for the first time** for a proposal, generate a `groupId` string (e.g. `GRP-<timestamp>` or a simple incremental ID).
- Store it in the group/proposal state so that:
  - It remains stable when navigating back and forth (Edit Proposal → Validation → Product Config).
  - It can be reused later by other modules.

### 1.2. Member navigation (tabs)

Below the group bar, create **member tabs**, similar to the existing "Member 1 / Member 2 / +" pattern, but now in the Product Config step:

- Each tab label should show the member index and name, e.g.:
  - `1. José Macel Augusto Ribeiro`
  - `2. Roberto Paulo Silva`
- The **leader** must always be the first member in the list (index 1).

Requirements:

- There must be a way to **change the leader**:
  - For now, use a simple control inside the Group bar or in a member tab (e.g. "Make leader").
  - When a different member is set as leader:
    - Update `group.leaderId`,
    - Reorder the members array so that this member becomes the first tab.

- You must allow:
  - Switching freely between member tabs without losing data.
  - Adding new members with a `+` tab/button (creates a new blank member and tab).
  - Removing members via a small `x` or delete action on the tab, with confirmation:
    - Show a confirm dialog before deleting.
    - Do not allow deleting the last remaining member.
    - If the leader is deleted, automatically make the first remaining member the new leader.

State handling:

- All form data for each member must be stored in a shared state such as:

  ```js
  Group {
    groupId,
    leaderId,
    members: Member[]
  }

  Member {
    id,
    personal: { ... },
    business: { ... },
    financial: { ... },
    credit: { ... }
  }
