You are updating ONLY the behavior of the **Requested Amount ($)** field on the New Proposal screen of Artemis Hunting MVP.

The previous instructions for this field should be overridden by the behavior described below.

---

## 1. Currency input should format as the user types

We want the classic “currency as cents” behavior:

- The user types **digits only**.
- Internally we treat the input as cents and format it as dollars on every keystroke.

Example (user types sequentially: `5`, `55`, `555`, `5555`, `55555`, `555555`):

- After `5`      → `$0.05`
- After `55`     → `$0.55`
- After `555`    → `$5.55`
- After `5555`   → `$55.55`
- After `55555`  → `$555.55`
- After `555555` → `$5,555.55`

Implementation guidance:

- On each `onChange`:
  1. Strip all non-digit characters from the raw input string.
  2. Interpret the resulting digits as **cents** (integer).
     - If there are no digits, treat as 0.
  3. Compute the numeric value in dollars: `amountInDollars = cents / 100`.
  4. Store this numeric value in component state for validation (e.g. a number).
  5. Format `amountInDollars` as a US currency string and set that as the input value, e.g. `$5,555.55`.

- The caret can simply move to the end of the input after each formatting; that is acceptable for this tablet-first use case.

- The user should be able to delete/backspace naturally: when deleting digits, the numeric value should shrink accordingly and the formatted string should update.

## 2. Validate max amount (50,000) when the user finishes typing (on blur)

The maximum allowed loan amount is **$50,000.00**.

We want the max check to occur **as soon as the user finishes typing and leaves the field** — not only when they click “Create Proposal”.

Behavior:

- On `onBlur` of the Requested Amount field:
  1. Use the internal numeric value (in dollars) you are storing in state.
  2. If the value is:
     - `<= 0` or not a number → treat as invalid (required) and show the existing “required” style/message.
     - `> 50,000` → show a specific error for max amount (see below).
     - Between `0` and `50,000` inclusive → the field is valid, clear any previous error for this field.

- Error message for max amount:
  - Show a clear message directly under the field, for example:
    - `Maximum loan amount is $50,000.00`
  - Visually mark the field as invalid (red border, red helper text) using the same style as other validation errors.

- As soon as the user edits the value again and it becomes `<= 50,000`:
  - Clear the max-amount error,
  - Keep the formatting behavior described in section 1.

---

## 3. Integrate with form submission

- When the user clicks **Create Proposal**, the form should still run full validation on all members and fields, including Requested Amount.

- For Requested Amount:
  - Use the **same numeric value** and rules from above:
    - required,
    - > 0,
    - <= 50,000.
  - If the value is invalid (empty, zero, or > 50,000), block submission and keep / show the appropriate error message under the field.

- If the value was already validated on blur and is valid, submission should not add any new error; it should simply reuse the existing valid state.

---

## 4. Summary

- Requested Amount behaves as a **live currency field** where:
  - user types digits only,
  - every keystroke updates the formatted value (`cents → dollars`),
  - examples: `5` → `$0.05`, `555555` → `$5,555.55`.

- On **blur**, the app:
  - validates the numeric value,
  - shows a clear error if the amount is greater than `$50,000.00`,
  - clears the error automatically when the user corrects it.

- On **Create Proposal**, the form re-checks the same rules and will not proceed if this field is invalid.

Do not change any other fields or behavior on this screen; only adjust the Requested Amount input and its validation as described above.
