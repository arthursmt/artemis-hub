You are helping me create the first MVP of a commercial app for microfinance field agents.

## Project context

Project name: **Artemis Hunting MPP**

This app is used by loan officers / credit agents in the field (microfinance context). They visit clients, originate credit proposals on tablets, and manage their portfolio. 

We are starting ONLY with the **front-end** (React) using **mocked data**. Later we will add a real **Node.js backend**, but for now there is NO real backend, only placeholder structure.

The goal of this first step (MPP) is:
- A working **Home screen** for the agent
- Basic **navigation** between the main pipeline screens
- All data coming from local **mock data** files

---

## Tech requirements

- Use **React** (JavaScript, not TypeScript for now).
- Single-page app is fine; you can use simple React state instead of a full router in this first step.
- File structure should be clean and modular, something like:

  - `src/App.jsx`
  - `src/index.jsx`
  - `src/components/` (reusable UI components)
  - `src/screens/` (each main screen)
  - `src/mock/` (mock data files)
  - `src/styles/` (global styles if needed)

- Create a folder called `backend/` with a simple `README.md` stating this will later contain a Node.js backend (do NOT implement backend logic now).

Use simple, clean styling (CSS or a minimal utility approach) targeting **tablet usage** (so layout should look good around 1024px width).

## Domain concepts (very important)

We are in **microfinance / microcredit**.

- A **proposal** is a credit application created by an agent.
- A **contract** is the approved and active loan.
- The app is centred on the **agent**, not on the client.

The agent sees:

- Their **Master KPIs**
- Their **credit pipeline** (stages of proposals and contracts)
- Entry point to create a **new credit proposal**

---

## Home Screen (Agent Dashboard) – Requirements

Create a main screen called **Home** (Agent Dashboard) with:

### 1. Header

- Simple header with:
  - App name: `Artemis Hunting`
  - Placeholder for agent name like: `Welcome, Agent Silva` (hardcoded is fine for now).

### 2. Master KPIs section

Create a **“Master KPIs”** section with **three main KPIs** the agent must always follow. These values must come from a **mock data file**, not hardcoded directly in the JSX.

The three master KPIs:

1. **Credit Portfolio**  
   - Label: `Credit Portfolio`
   - Description: Total outstanding loan amount in the agent’s portfolio.
   - Show a value like `$120,000` (mocked).

2. **Client Portfolio**  
   - Label: `Active Clients`
   - Description: Number of clients with active contracts in the agent’s portfolio.
   - Show a value like `85` (mocked).

3. **Delinquency Rate**  
   - Label: `Delinquency`
   - Description: Percentage of the portfolio that is overdue.
   - Show a value like `4.8%` (mocked).

Layout:
- Display these three KPIs as **cards** in a responsive grid (e.g. 3 columns on tablet, stacked on smaller screens).
- Each card can show:
  - Title (label)
  - Main value
  - Small subtitle/description.

The KPI values should be read from something like `src/mock/kpis.js`.

### 3. Pipeline Overview section

Below the Master KPIs, create a **“Pipeline Overview”** section.

We have five stages in the agent’s pipeline:

1. **On Going**  
   - Proposals that have been started but are **incomplete** (missing data or documents).

2. **Under Evaluation**  
   - Proposals that are **complete** (all data, documents, signatures) and have been **sent to the backoffice / risk workflow**.

3. **Completed**  
   - Proposals that have been **approved** and turned into contracts in the **last 30 days**.

4. **Renewals**  
   - Contracts that will reach maturity in the **next 60 days** and have not yet been renewed.

5. **Collections**  
   - Contracts with **overdue payments** (delinquent contracts).

UI:

- Show these five stages as **cards** or tiles in a grid.
- Each card must show:
  - Stage name (e.g. `On Going`)
  - A short description
  - A **count** of items in that stage (coming from mock data).
- The cards must be **clickable**:
  - Clicking a card navigates to the respective screen:
    - On Going → `OnGoingProposalsScreen`
    - Under Evaluation → `UnderEvaluationProposalsScreen`
    - Completed → `CompletedProposalsScreen`
    - Renewals → `RenewalsScreen`
    - Collections → `CollectionsScreen`

The counts should be derived from a **shared mock data source**, for example `src/mock/proposals.js` and `src/mock/contracts.js`.

### 4. New Proposal CTA

On the Home screen, include a clear primary button:

- Label: `New Credit Proposal`
- When clicked, it should navigate to a **placeholder** screen called `NewProposalScreen` where later we will build a multi-step form.

For now, the `NewProposalScreen` can just show:

- Title: `New Credit Proposal`
- Text: `This will be the multi-step proposal form (coming soon).`

## Navigation and State Management

For this first version, use **simple React state** in `App.jsx` to handle which screen is currently visible.

Example approach:

- Have a state variable like `currentScreen` with possible values:
  - `"home"`
  - `"ongoing"`
  - `"under_evaluation"`
  - `"completed"`
  - `"renewals"`
  - `"collections"`
  - `"new_proposal"`

- Clicking each pipeline card on Home sets `currentScreen` to the corresponding value.
- Clicking the `New Credit Proposal` button also sets `currentScreen` to `"new_proposal"`.
- Provide a way to go back to Home from each screen (e.g. a simple “Back to Home” link or top navigation).

No external routing library is required for this step (React Router is optional; if you think it helps, you can add it, but keep things simple).

## Screens for each stage (first version)

Create basic screens under `src/screens/`:

- `HomeScreen.jsx`
- `OnGoingProposalsScreen.jsx`
- `UnderEvaluationProposalsScreen.jsx`
- `CompletedProposalsScreen.jsx`
- `RenewalsScreen.jsx`
- `CollectionsScreen.jsx`
- `NewProposalScreen.jsx`

For this first version:

- Each screen should have:
  - A title (e.g. `On Going Proposals`)
  - A short description of what that stage represents.
  - A **simple table or list** of items from mock data.

### Mock data structure suggestion

Create `src/mock/proposals.js` with an array of proposal objects, for example:

```js
export const proposals = [
  {
    id: "P-001",
    clientName: "Maria Gomez",
    amount: 1500,
    status: "on_going", // or "under_evaluation", "completed"
    createdAt: "2025-01-10",
    updatedAt: "2025-01-12",
    approvedAt: null,
  },
  // more proposals...
];
