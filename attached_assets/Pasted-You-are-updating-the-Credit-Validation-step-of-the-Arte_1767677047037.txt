You are updating the **Credit Validation** step of the Artemis Hunting MVP flow.

Do NOT change the existing UI layout or styling of this screen (member cards, statuses, buttons).  
Only implement the navigation and enable/disable logic described below.

The screen currently has:
- A list of members with validation results (Approved / Denied / Pending).
- A bottom bar with two buttons:
  - `Edit Proposal`
  - `Continue to Product Config`

Assume there is a previous step (New Proposal screen) and an initial Dashboard/Home screen.

---

## 1) Edit Proposal must return to the previous screen with data preserved

Current issue:
- Clicking **Edit Proposal** may reset data or not correctly return to the data entry step.

Required behavior:

1. When the user clicks **Edit Proposal**:
   - Navigate back to the **New Proposal** screen (the step where the members’ names, amounts and documents are entered).
   - All member data previously entered (names, requested amounts, document type, document number, group members) must still be present and editable.
   - The user should be editing the **same proposal instance**, not starting a new one.

2. Implementation guidance:

   - Store the proposal and member data in a shared state that survives navigation, for example:
     - React context, or
     - A parent component that manages both steps and passes props, or
     - Any existing global store the app is already using.
   - Do NOT reinitialize the members array when navigating back via Edit Proposal.
   - After the user updates the data and clicks `Create Proposal` again, the flow should return to the Credit Validation step and re-run the simulated validations with the updated data.

## 2) Behavior when all members are denied and then removed

Use the existing logic that allows **removing members** from the Credit Validation screen (e.g., for denied members).

Required behavior:

1. If **all members have been denied** and the user chooses to remove every one of them (one by one):

   - After the last member is removed and there are **no members left** in the proposal:
     - Navigate the user back to the **Dashboard / Home** screen (the initial app screen).
     - Optionally, clear the current proposal state, since there is no proposal left.

2. In other words:
   - When the members list becomes empty on the Credit Validation screen, automatically route back to the home/dashboard route (e.g. `/` or the existing dashboard path).

## 3) Enabling / disabling “Continue to Product Config”

We must control the **Continue to Product Config** button based on the validation results of the members.

Definitions:

- Each member has an overall status derived from the checks:
  - `Approved`
  - `Denied`
  - `In Progress` (or `Pending`) – while checks are still running.

Required behavior:

1. The **Continue to Product Config** button should be **disabled** when:
   - There is at least one member with status `Denied`, OR
   - There is at least one member whose validation is still `Pending` / `In Progress`.

2. The **Continue to Product Config** button should be **enabled** only when:
   - There is **at least one member**, AND
   - **All** remaining members have status `Approved` (no `Denied`, no `Pending`).

3. Specific scenario requested:

   - If there is at least one denied member and at least one approved member:
     - The button **must remain disabled**.
     - The user must remove all denied members from the proposal on this screen before they can proceed.
     - Once all denied members have been removed and all remaining members are approved, the button becomes enabled.

4. When the user clicks **Continue to Product Config**:
   - Only allow navigation to the next step (Product Config screen) if the button is enabled (i.e., all remaining members are approved).
   - If the button is disabled, the click should do nothing (or at most show a subtle explanation).

Implementation guidance:

- Compute a derived state, for example:

  ```js
  const hasMembers = members.length > 0;
  const hasDenied = members.some(m => m.status === "denied");
  const hasPending = members.some(m => m.status === "pending" || m.status === "in_progress");
  const allApproved = hasMembers && !hasDenied && !hasPending;

  const canContinue = allApproved;
