You are fixing THREE specific issues on the **New Proposal** screen of the Artemis Hunting MVP app.  
Do NOT change the overall layout or add new features. Only adjust the behavior and styling described below.

The screen already has:
- Member tabs (Member 1, Member 2, etc.)
- First / Middle / Last Name
- Requested Amount ($)
- ID Document Type (dropdown)
- Document Number
- A delete (x) icon on each member tab that currently shows a confirmation dialog.

---

## 1) Fix Requested Amount ($) input behavior

Current problems:
- When the user types zeros at the end of the number, the field does not accept them correctly (e.g., trying to enter 50000 results in `0.05` or similar).
- When the value exceeds 50,000, the field automatically changes the value, which is confusing.

Required behavior:

1. Let the user type any numeric value they want (digits and optionally a decimal point), including trailing zeros.  
   - Do NOT aggressively reformat the value while the user is typing in a way that changes the meaning.
   - You may apply currency formatting **on blur** (when the input loses focus) instead of on every keystroke to avoid interfering with typing.

2. Currency formatting:
   - Display the value as a US dollar amount when formatted, for example:
     - User types `50000` → on blur, the field shows `$50,000.00`.
   - Internally, keep the numeric value (e.g. `50000`) for validation.

3. Maximum loan amount:
   - The maximum allowed value is 50,000.
   - **Do NOT automatically change the value** if the user enters more than 50,000.
   - Instead, if the numeric value is greater than 50000:
     - Keep what the user typed.
     - Show a validation error message below the field such as:
       - `Maximum loan amount is $50,000.`
     - Prevent form submission until the user corrects the value.

4. Required:
   - The field is required and must be greater than 0.
   - If empty or 0, show the existing "required" style/error.

In short: allow the user to type freely (including zeros), format nicely, and only use an **error message** to enforce the 50,000 limit instead of clamping or rewriting the value to 0.05 or 50,000.

## 2) Improve readability of the ID Document Type dropdown (selected/hover colors)

Current problem:
- The dropdown uses very light colors, so the selected option and hover states are hard to read against the background.

Required changes:

1. Update the dropdown menu styling so that:
   - The menu background is a solid light color (e.g. white or very light gray).
   - The text color of options is a dark, high-contrast color (e.g. the same dark text used in the rest of the app).
   - The **selected** option has a clearly visible background (for example, a light blue) with dark text.
   - The **hovered** option also has a visible background highlight.

2. Make sure the currently selected option in the closed state of the select:
   - Is easy to read (dark text on light background).
   - Does not use a washed-out color.

Do not change the list of options or their labels, only the colors / styles so that the selected value is clearly legible.

## 3) Only show the “remove member” confirmation when there is data

Current behavior:
- Clicking the `x` on a member tab always shows a confirmation dialog (`Are you sure you want to remove this member from the group?`), even if all fields are empty.

Required behavior:

1. Before showing the confirmation dialog, check if the member has **any required field filled**.

   Required fields per member are:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Requested Amount ($)
   - ID Document Type
   - Document Number

2. Logic:

   - If **all** these fields for that member are empty / unset (e.g. empty string, null, or default value):
     - Remove the member **immediately without any confirmation dialog**.
   - If **any** of these fields has been filled (user entered something):
     - THEN show the confirmation dialog:
       - `Are you sure you want to remove this member from the group?`
     - Only remove the member if the user confirms.

3. Keep existing rules:
   - Do not allow deleting the last remaining member (there must always be at least one member).
   - When a member is deleted, switch the active tab to a remaining member (e.g. previous or first).

Implementation hint:
- Assuming you store members in an array like `members[index]`, compute something like:

  ```js
  const hasData =
    !!member.firstName ||
    !!member.lastName ||
    !!member.requestedAmount ||
    !!member.documentType ||
    !!member.documentNumber;
