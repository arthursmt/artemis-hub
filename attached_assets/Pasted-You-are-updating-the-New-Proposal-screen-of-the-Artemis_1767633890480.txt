You are updating the **New Proposal** screen of the Artemis Hunting MVP React app.

Use the current layout as the base (title, subtitle, form card, buttons).  
Do NOT remove the existing "Client Name" and "Requested Amount ($)" fields or change the general structure/styling of the form card.  
Only extend it with the following features.

---

## 1. Add "Proposal Type" (Group vs Individual)

At the top of the form, just above the fields for client information, add a **"Proposal Type"** control:

- Label: `Proposal Type`
- Options:
  - `Group`
  - `Individual`

Implementation guidance:

- Use a segmented control or radio buttons styled horizontally (for example, two pills side by side).
- **Default value** must be `Group`.
- When `Individual` is selected:
  - The form behaves as a single-client proposal.
- When `Group` is selected:
  - The form supports multiple members (see section 2 below).

Keep the layout tablet-friendly and consistent with the current visual style.

---

## 2. Support multiple group members (tabs + “+” button)

When **Proposal Type = Group**, the agent must be able to add multiple members to the same proposal.

### 2.1. Member tabs

Just above the input fields, add a **row of member tabs**, for example:

- `Member 1` | `Member 2` | `Member 3` | `[ + ]`

Requirements:

- Start with a single member by default:
  - Only `Member 1` tab is visible (selected).
- At the end of the tab row, add a small **“+” tab/button**:
  - Clicking `+` creates a new member and a new tab:
    - `Member 2`, `Member 3`, etc.
  - The new tab becomes the active one and shows empty fields for that member.

Each tab should visually indicate which member is currently active (e.g. highlighted background or underline).

### 2.2. Member fields

For each member, inside the form card, the fields should be:

1. **Client Name** (use the existing field)
   - The label and placeholder can stay as they are.
   - Internally, this should be stored per member (e.g. `member.name`).

2. **Requested Amount ($)** (keep as it is)
   - Also stored per member.

3. **ID Document Type** (new field – dropdown)
   - Label: `ID Document Type`
   - Input type: select / dropdown.
   - Options (at least the following):
     - `Social Security Number (SSN)`
     - `Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)`
     - `US Driver’s License / State ID`
     - `Passport`
     - `Foreign Government ID` (for foreign national IDs or consular IDs)
   - You can define these options in a small constant array in the component or in a separate config file.

4. **ID Document Number** (new field – text input)
   - Label: `Document Number`
   - Simple text input where the agent types the chosen document’s number.

All these fields must be **per member**. Changing data in `Member 2` must not affect `Member 1`, etc.

### 2.3. Removing a member

The agent must be able to **remove** members in a group proposal.

- Add a small remove/delete control on each member tab, for example:
  - a small "x" icon or trash icon on the tab (except maybe the first member).
- When the user clicks this remove icon:
  - Show a **confirmation dialog**, e.g.:

    ```js
    window.confirm("Are you sure you want to remove this member from the group?");
    ```

  - Only remove the member if the user confirms.
- Do **not** allow deleting the last remaining member:
  - There must always be at least one member in the group.
  - If the user tries to delete the only member, show a message or simply block the action.

When the currently selected member is removed, switch the view to a remaining member (e.g. the previous one or the first).

### 2.4. Switching between Group and Individual

- When **switching from Group to Individual**:
  - You may keep only the **first member** data as the single client for the proposal.
  - Hide the member tabs and the "+" button.
- When **switching from Individual back to Group**:
  - You can start again with one member (Member 1) and allow adding more via "+".
  - For this first version, it is acceptable if previous extra members are not preserved when toggling types.

---

## 3. Maintain existing layout and buttons

- Keep the **title** (`New Proposal`) and subtitle (`Originate a new credit application.`) exactly as they are.
- Keep the main form card styling (shadow, padding, rounded corners).
- Keep the **Cancel** and **Create Proposal** buttons with their current styling and positions.
- The `Create Proposal` button should eventually submit all member data (for now, it is fine if it just logs the payload to the console or prepares an object containing proposal type and members).

---

## 4. Suggested data structure (for internal state)

You can manage the form state with React hooks.  
For guidance, you may use a structure like:

```js
const [proposalType, setProposalType] = useState("group"); // "group" | "individual"

const [members, setMembers] = useState([
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "",
    requestedAmount: "",
    documentType: "",
    documentNumber: "",
  },
  // additional members...
]);
