You are modifying an existing React project called **Artemis Hunting**.  
Please apply the following changes to the current codebase.

---

## 1. Rename the project from MPP to MVP

Everywhere in the UI and project where the text appears as:

- `Artemis HUNTING MPP`
- `HUNTING MPP`

update it to:

- `Artemis HUNTING MVP`
- `HUNTING MVP`

This includes the header title, any subtitles, and any visible labels in the app. The brand name `Artemis` and the logo remain the same.

---

## 2. Fix the logo rendering in the header

In the top-left header, the Artemis logo is currently shown inside a square with grey/empty space around it. It looks like the logo does not fill the container.

Update the header logo so that:

- The logo image **fills its container** (no grey or empty borders).
- The container can be either:
  - a square with rounded corners, or
  - a slightly rounded rectangle that fits the logo aspect ratio,
- but in all cases:
  - the logo should be clearly visible and centered,
  - there should be no grey padding or background that makes it look “floating in a grey box”.

Implementation guidelines:

- Use a fixed-size container (for example 40x40 or similar) with `border-radius` for rounded corners.
- Make the `<img>` element fill the container:
  - `width: 100%`
  - `height: 100%`
  - `object-fit: contain` (or `cover` if it looks better with this particular logo).
- Use a **white** or transparent background so the logo integrates nicely with the header.

## 3. Update master KPIs data structure and UI

Update the mock file that defines the master KPIs (for example `src/mock/kpis.js`) to use the following structure exactly:

```js
export const masterKpis = {
  creditPortfolio: {
    label: "Credit Portfolio",
    currentValue: 450000,
    lastMonthValue: 400000,
  },
  activeClients: {
    label: "Active Clients",
    currentValue: 124,
    lastMonthValue: 120,
  },
  delinquencyRate: {
    label: "Delinquency Rate",
    currentValue: 0.024, // 2.4%
    lastMonthValue: 0.026, // 2.6%
  },
  monthlyGoal: {
    targetDisbursement: 600000,
    achievedDisbursement: 390000, // → 65% of the target
  },
};
