Implementation:

Remove the proposal with that id from the proposals array.

Update state so that any screen subscribed to the context re-renders.

You do NOT need to implement archival; just a hard delete from the local store for now.

2) Update the Actions column on the On Going Proposals list

On the On Going Proposals screen (the table view at /ongoing):

Keep the existing "Keep filling" action.

Add two more actions per row:

"View details"

"Delete"

Suggested layout (but keep existing design language):

Primary action: a button or pill labeled "Keep filling".

Below or next to it:

A subtle text button/link "View details".

A text button/link "Delete" styled in a danger color (e.g. red).

All labels must be in English, exactly: "Keep filling", "View details", "Delete".

3) Delete behavior with confirmation

When the user clicks "Delete" for a given proposal row:

Show a confirmation dialog/modal (use the browser window.confirm or a custom modal, depending on what the app already uses), with text similar to:

Title: Delete proposal

Message:
Are you sure you want to delete this proposal? This will remove all related data and cannot be undone.

If the user confirms:

Call deleteProposal(proposal.id) from the ProposalsContext.

The row must disappear from the On Going Proposals table.

If this was the last proposal, show an empty state message like:

No ongoing proposals at the moment.

If the user cancels:

Do nothing.

This delete must affect only the local proposals store (no backend yet).

4) Proposal details view ("View details")

You must implement a Proposal Details view to show the group and member details.

You can choose one of these patterns (whichever fits the current routing best):

A new route: e.g. /ongoing/:proposalId/details

OR a full-screen overlay/modal on top of the On Going list.

The simplest option is a new route with a back arrow, similar style to other pages.
I will describe it as a separate screen:

4.1. Navigation

When the user clicks "View details" in the Actions column:

Navigate to a details screen with the proposal id in the route, for example:

/ongoing/${proposal.id}/details.

On the details screen:

Include a back arrow/button at the top-left that returns to the On Going Proposals list (/ongoing).

4.2. Data loading

The details screen must:

Read proposalId from the route params.

Use getProposalById(proposalId) from the ProposalsContext.

If the proposal does not exist (e.g. deleted) → redirect back to /ongoing or show a simple error.

4.3. Layout and fields

The Proposal Details view should show:

Header section (card-style):

Group ID – show proposal.groupId or "--" if not available.

Leader – show proposal.leaderName (this should always exist).

Total Amount – show proposal.totalAmount formatted as currency.

Date Created – show proposal.dateCreated formatted as in the table.

Members section – a simple list or table for each member in proposal.data.group.members.

For each member row, display:

Member name – First Name + Last Name (or "--" if missing).

Primary phone – use the first contact phone from that member’s personal data; if not present, show "--".

Requested amount – the member’s requested loan amount (from the loan proposal or original requested amount); if missing, show "--".

Address – combine the available address fields, for example:

Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, State, ZIP

If you cannot build a readable string because everything is empty, show "--".

Label everything in English, for example:

Section titles: Group details, Members.

Column titles: Name, Primary phone, Requested amount, Address.

4.4. Handling missing data

You must respect this rule:

When a certain field does not have data, show "--" (two dashes) instead of leaving it blank or showing null/undefined.

Examples:

Missing phone → "--"

Missing address line → can be omitted from the concatenated address string, but if the entire address is empty, show "--".

Missing requested amount → "--"

5) Summary of required behavior

After your changes, the On Going Proposals flow must support:

A Keep filling action (existing) that reopens Product Configuration for that proposal.

A View details action that navigates to a Proposal Details screen and shows:

Group ID, leader, total amount, date created.

Member list: name, primary phone, requested amount, address, using "--" when data is not available.

A Delete action that:

Asks for confirmation,

Deletes the proposal and all related data from the local proposals store when confirmed,

Updates the table immediately, and shows an empty state message if there are no more ongoing proposals.

All UI text for these new elements must be in English.
