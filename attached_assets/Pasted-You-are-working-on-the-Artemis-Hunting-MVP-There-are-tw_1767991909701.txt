You are working on the Artemis Hunting MVP.

There are two tasks:

1) Improve the layout of the Actions column on the "On Going Proposals" screen.
2) Implement the first form tab (Loan Details) on the Product Configuration screen.

Please follow the instructions carefully and keep all UI texts in English.

## 1) On Going Proposals – better Actions layout

Current issue:
- The Actions column on `/ongoing` feels cramped: "Keep filling", "View details" and "Delete" are too close to each other and hard to tap, even though there is plenty of horizontal space.

Requirements:

1. Keep the **table structure and columns** as they are:
   - Client Name, Amount, Date Created, Status, Actions.

2. Redesign the **Actions** cell for each row as a clearer, spaced layout:
   - Use a vertical layout (flex column) inside the Actions cell:
     - **Top element**: a full-width primary button `Keep filling` (same style as now).
     - **Bottom row**: two text-style actions with enough spacing:
       - Left-aligned: `View details`
       - Right-aligned: `Delete` in a danger color (red) to signal destructive action.

   Visually, it should look like:
   - First line: big blue `Keep filling` button spanning most of the width of the cell.
   - Second line: `View details` on the left, `Delete` on the right, with clear padding and line height so both are easy to tap.

3. Do **not** change the existing behaviors:
   - `Keep filling` must still reopen Product Configuration for that proposal.
   - `View details` must still navigate to the proposal details view.
   - `Delete` must still show a confirmation and, if confirmed, delete the proposal from the local proposals store and update the list.

4. Make sure the new layout:
   - Works well on tablet-sized screens.
   - Looks consistent with the current design system (same fonts, colors, hover states).

## 2) Product Configuration – first tab: Loan Details

You already have a Product Configuration screen at `/product-config` with:
- A header.
- Navigation back to validation.
- A placeholder area where forms will be configured.
- The concept of proposals and members already stored in a Proposals store.

Now we need to turn this into a **multi-member, multi-step form**, and implement the **first step (Loan Details)**.

### 2.1. Member navigation

At the top of the form area:

- Show a horizontal tab bar for members, something like:
  - `Member 1 | Member 2 | Member 3 | ...`
- The first member should be selected by default.
- When the user clicks another member tab:
  - Switch the form to show that member’s data.
  - Keep all previously entered values in memory using the same Proposals store.

You can reuse the member concept from previous steps (the group created in New Proposal and validated in the Credit Validation screen).

### 2.2. Form step navigation (sub-tabs)

Below the member tabs, add a **second row of sub-tabs** for the form steps:

- `Loan Details` (first tab – active now)
- `Personal Data`
- `Business Data`
- `Financial Profile / P&L`

For now:
- Implement only the **Loan Details** tab content.
- The other tabs can be shown as disabled or non-clickable placeholders.

### 2.3. Layout for Loan Details

Inside the Loan Details tab:

- Use a **card-style form** similar to other cards in the app.
- Use a clean two-column layout when there is enough space, with generous vertical spacing between rows so the screen does not feel cramped.
- Add a section title: `Loan structure`.

Fields to implement (all in English):

1. **Loan Value** (mandatory)
   - Type: numeric, with currency formatting.
   - Behavior:
     - Pre-fill with the `Requested Amount` entered earlier for this member.
     - Reuse the same currency mask behavior as the previous amount field:
       - While the user types, format as dollars (e.g. typing `555555` becomes `$5,555.55`).
     - Keep the existing maximum loan rule (50,000):
       - If the user enters a value greater than 50,000, show an inline error like:
         `Maximum loan value is $50,000.00`
       - Do not let the user proceed to the next step while this error is active.

2. **Loan Type** (mandatory)
   - Type: text stored, but implemented as a dropdown for better UX.
   - Label: `Loan type`
   - Options (for now, fixed list):
     - `Working capital`
     - `Investment`
     - `Other`
   - If `Other` is selected, the `Other goal` field (see below) becomes more relevant.

3. **Interest Rate** (mandatory)
   - Type: numeric.
   - Label: `Interest rate (%)`
   - Behavior:
     - Accept only numbers and decimal separator.
     - Show inline validation if empty or not a valid number.

4. **Number of Installments** (mandatory)
   - Type: numeric.
   - Label: `Number of installments`
   - Behavior:
     - Accept only integers.
     - For now, enforce a range between 4 and 12:
       - If outside that range, show inline error:
         `Number of installments must be between 4 and 12`

5. **First Payment Date** (mandatory)
   - Type: date.
   - Label: `First payment date`
   - Behavior:
     - Use a date picker.
     - Default value:
       - Based on the current date, calculate 60 days of grace.
       - Then set the default first payment date to the first half of the following month (days 1–15).
     - The user can adjust the date, but only to dates **on or after** this default.
     - If the selected date is before the allowed minimum, show an inline error.

6. **Grace Period** (mandatory)
   - Type: numeric.
   - Label: `Grace period (days)`
   - Behavior:
     - Default to `60`.
     - Accept only integers.
     - Show inline error if empty or less than 0.

7. **Loan Goal** (mandatory)
   - Type: text.
   - Label: `Loan goal`
   - Implementation:
     - Use either a dropdown with common goals (e.g. `Inventory`, `Equipment`, `Working capital`, `Debt consolidation`, `Other`) or a text input.
   - If you implement a dropdown and the user selects `Other`, they should be encouraged to fill `Other goal`.

8. **Other Goal** (optional)
   - Type: text.
   - Label: `Other goal (optional)`
   - Behavior:
     - Optional field.
     - If `Loan goal` is set to `Other`, you can visually hint that this field should be filled, but do not make it required.

9. **Borrower's Insurance** (mandatory)
   - Type: boolean.
   - Label: `Borrower's insurance`
   - Implementation:
     - Use radio buttons (`Yes`, `No`) or a toggle switch.
   - Show an inline error if no option is selected when the user tries to proceed.

10. **Optional Insurance 1** (optional)
    - Type: list.
    - Label: `Optional insurance 1`
    - Implementation:
      - Dropdown with placeholder options like:
        - `None`
        - `Life coverage`
        - `Disability coverage`
        - `Job loss coverage`
      - Default to `None`.

11. **Optional Insurance 2** (optional)
    - Same as Optional insurance 1.

12. **Optional Insurance 3** (optional)
    - Same as Optional insurance 1.

### 2.4. Validation and persistence

- All fields marked as mandatory must be validated when:
  - The user clicks the **Next step** button on the Product Configuration screen.
- Show inline error messages under each field that fails validation, with clear text like:
  - `Loan value is required`
  - `Interest rate is required`
  - `First payment date is required`, etc.

- Only allow progression to the next step (future tabs) when:
  - All mandatory fields in *Loan Details* for the **current member** are valid.
- All values entered in Loan Details must be stored in the existing **Proposals store**, under the corresponding proposal and member, so that:
  - Switching between member tabs keeps the data.
  - Returning from `/product-config` via "Keep filling" reloads all saved values.

### 2.5. Navigation buttons

- Keep the bottom navigation as:
  - Left button: `Back to Home` (or `Back` if you already renamed it) – returns to the main Dashboard.
  - Right button: `Next step` – validates Loan Details and, if valid, will later take the user to the next sub-tab (Personal Data). For now it can show a placeholder message or keep the user on the same screen, but the validation logic must be in place.

---

Summary:

1. Improve the Actions column on `/ongoing` so that `Keep filling`, `View details`, and `Delete` are well spaced and easy to tap.
2. Implement the `Loan Details` sub-tab of the Product Configuration screen:
   - Member tabs at the top.
   - Sub-tabs row with `Loan Details` active.
   - All specified fields with validation, defaults, and persistence in the Proposals store.
   - Respect previous behaviors (loan amount limit, navigation from validation, etc.).

All labels and error messages must be in English and consistent with the current design language of the Artemis Hunting MVP.
