You are updating the existing **Artemis Hunting MVP** React project.  
Please modify ONLY the Dashboard screen and related data to match the following specification.

---

## 0. Keep the current layout as a base

Do NOT change:

- The header (logo, "Artemis HUNTING MVP" text)
- The search bar and notification bell
- The "New Proposal" button
- The Pipeline Overview section structure (the five stage cards and their counts)
- The New Proposal flow

We only want to adjust:

- The KPI cards on the top row
- The progress bars inside those cards
- The Pipeline card icon for "Under Eval"
- Remove the "Overall Goal Performance" section if it still exists

---

## 1. Remove the "Overall Goal Performance" section

If there is any section, card, or component that shows:

- "Overall Goal Performance"
- or a combined bar with percentages for all KPIs

Remove that from the Dashboard JSX and any related styles or mock data.

The Dashboard layout should now be:

1. Header
2. Title + subtitle ("Dashboard" + description)
3. Top row with the three KPI cards:
   - Credit Portfolio
   - Active Clients
   - Delinquency Rate
4. Pipeline Overview section with the five stage cards

No extra goal summary strip/card in between.

---

## 2. Update master KPI mock data

Update the mock file that defines the KPIs (for example `src/mock/kpis.js`) to use this structure:

```js
export const masterKpis = {
  creditPortfolio: {
    label: "Credit Portfolio",
    currentValue: 450000,
    lastMonthValue: 400000,
    targetValue: 600000,
    progressPercent: 65, // 65% of target
    status: "on_track",  // good running rate, not completed yet
  },
  activeClients: {
    label: "Active Clients",
    currentValue: 124,
    lastMonthValue: 120,
    targetValue: 180,
    progressPercent: 69, // 69% of target
    status: "on_track",  // good running rate, close to completion
  },
  delinquencyRate: {
    label: "Delinquency Rate",
    currentValue: 0.024, // 2.4%
    lastMonthValue: 0.026, // 2.6%
    targetValue: 0.03,    // goal: stay at or below 3%
    progressPercent: 80,  // 80% "goal health"
    status: "at_risk",    // running behind / at risk of failing
  },
};
