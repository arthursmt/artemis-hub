You are working on the Artemis Hunting MVP React project.

Right now, the Product Configuration page still shows a placeholder instead of a real form. I want you to replace that placeholder with an actual **Loan Details** form for the current group member.

## 1. Find the correct component

1. Search the codebase for the string:

   "Configuration forms for"

   This text is currently rendered in the Product Configuration screen (e.g. "Configuration forms for adddfa").

2. Identify the React component that renders this text. It is the component used by the `/product-config/:proposalId` route.

3. **Do not** change the header, the dark banner with GROUP ID / LEADER, or the member tabs row. Only replace the placeholder card that currently shows the icon and the text "Configuration forms for ...".

## 2. Replace the placeholder with a Loan Details form

Inside that placeholder card, render a form with the following requirements:

- At the top-left of the card, show a section title: `Loan Details`.
- Under the title, use a **two-column layout** (CSS grid or flex) when there is enough horizontal space (tablet/desktop).
- Use the same input styles and spacing that other forms in the app already use (rounded inputs, generous vertical spacing).

### Fields to implement

Implement these fields, with these labels and basic types:

1. **Loan Value** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Loan value ($)`
   - HTML type: `number` (for now).
   - This field is required.

2. **Loan Type** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Loan type`
   - Implement as a `<select>` dropdown.
   - Options:
     - `Working capital`
     - `Investment`
     - `Other`
   - This field is required.

3. **Interest Rate** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Interest rate (%)`
   - HTML type: `number`.
   - This field is required.

4. **Number of Installments** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Number of installments`
   - HTML type: `number`.
   - This field is required.

5. **First Payment Date** (mandatory)
   - Label: `First payment date`
   - HTML type: `date`.
   - This field is required.

6. **Grace Period** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Grace period (days)`
   - HTML type: `number`.
   - This field is required.

7. **Loan Goal** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Loan goal`
   - Implement as a `<select>` dropdown.
   - Options:
     - `Inventory`
     - `Equipment`
     - `Working capital`
     - `Debt consolidation`
     - `Other`
   - This field is required.

8. **Other Goal** (optional)
   - Label: `Other goal (optional)`
   - HTML type: `text`.
   - This field is optional.

9. **Borrower's Insurance** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Borrower's insurance`
   - Implement as radio buttons or a toggle with two clear options:
     - `Yes`
     - `No`
   - One of the options must be selected before saving.

10. **Optional Insurance 1** (optional)
    - Label: `Optional insurance 1`
    - `<select>` with options:
      - `None`
      - `Life coverage`
      - `Disability coverage`
      - `Job loss coverage`
    - Default: `None`.

11. **Optional Insurance 2** (optional)
    - Same structure as Optional insurance 1.

12. **Optional Insurance 3** (optional)
    - Same structure as Optional insurance 1.

### Layout suggestion

Use a layout roughly like this inside the card:

- First row (two columns):
  - Left: Loan value
  - Right: Loan type

- Second row:
  - Left: Interest rate
  - Right: Number of installments

- Third row:
  - Left: First payment date
  - Right: Grace period

- Fourth row:
  - Left: Loan goal
  - Right: Borrower's insurance

- Below (full-width rows):
  - Other goal (optional)
  - Optional insurance 1
  - Optional insurance 2
  - Optional insurance 3

Make sure there is enough vertical spacing between rows so the form feels spacious and easy to use on a tablet screen.

## 3. State and validation (simple version)

For this step, implement **simple** state and validation:

1. Use React state in this component to hold the form values for the *currently selected member*.
2. When the member tab changes, you can keep it simple for now:
   - It is acceptable in this version if the values are not yet persisted per member.
   - Later we will extend this to persist values per member and into the proposals store.

3. Validation rules (simple):
   - All fields marked as mandatory must not be empty.
   - When the user clicks the existing `Save & Exit` button:
     - Check required fields.
     - If any required field is empty, show a small red error text under that field, e.g. `This field is required`, and do not navigate away.
     - If all required fields are filled, you can log the data to the console and then keep the existing `Save & Exit` navigation behavior (navigate back as it already does).

IMPORTANT:
- Do not remove or rename the existing `Save & Exit` button.
- Do not change other routes or screens.
- The main goal of this change is: when I click “Continue to Product Config” and land on this page, I can actually type values into a **Loan Details form** instead of seeing a placeholder message.

All labels and helper texts must remain in English.
