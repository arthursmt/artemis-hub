You are in artemis-hunt. Goal: unblock E2E submission to Arise. Current failure:
- localStorage quota exceeded storing "artemis_proposals"
- submit request to /api/proposals/submit returns 413 Request Entity Too Large

Do NOT refactor the whole app. Make minimal, explicit changes to:
A) Prevent localStorage quota crash
B) Prevent 413 on submit for demo

A) localStorage quota fix (mandatory)
- Find where proposals are persisted to localStorage key "artemis_proposals" (error points to client/src/lib/proposalStore.tsx around the shown line).
- Change persistence to store ONLY a lightweight summary list (no photos, no base64, no signatures, no large blobs).
  Example stored shape:
  [{ id, status, leaderName, membersCount, totalAmount, updatedAt }]
- Keep the in-memory full proposal state unchanged.
- Add a try/catch around localStorage writes; on quota error, gracefully clear the stored cache and continue without crashing.

B) 413 fix (mandatory)
- Identify what handles POST /api/proposals/submit in this repo:
  - If there is a backend/proxy server in this repo, increase JSON/body size limits to at least 25mb.
    * Express example: express.json({limit:'25mb'}) and urlencoded({limit:'25mb'})
    * Fastify example: bodyLimit config
  - If /api/proposals/submit is called directly to Arise from the browser, then reduce payload size by stripping heavy fields (photos/signatures/base64) before sending for the MVP demo.
    Implement a function like:
      function stripHeavyFields(payload) { remove evidence binaries; keep metadata only }
    and use it ONLY for the submit call (keep UI data intact).

C) Add diagnostics (mandatory)
- Right before submit, log:
  console.log("[HUNT SUBMIT] bytes=", new Blob([JSON.stringify(payloadToSend)]).size)
  console.log("[HUNT SUBMIT] keys=", Object.keys(payloadToSend))
- If response is 413, show a UI toast that includes the computed bytes size.

Deliverables:
1) FILES CHANGED (paths)
2) For each file: full code blocks ready to paste
3) Where submit happens today (file + exact line ranges)
4) How to test:
   - Open Hunt, create proposal, attach minimal photo (or none), submit
   - Confirm network request succeeds (200/201)
   - Confirm no localStorage quota crash
5) Expected result: proposal submitted successfully and visible in Gate inbox (once Gate points to same Arise).
