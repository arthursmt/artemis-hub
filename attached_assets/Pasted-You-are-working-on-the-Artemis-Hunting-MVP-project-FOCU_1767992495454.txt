You are working on the Artemis Hunting MVP project.

FOCUS ONLY ON THE PRODUCT CONFIGURATION SCREEN (the /product-config/:proposalId route). Do NOT change other routes or components.

## Current situation

- When I go to Product Configuration, I see:
  - A header with "ARTEMIS HUNTING MVP" and "Product Configuration".
  - A dark block with:
    - GROUP ID (e.g., GRP-1769792269244)
    - LEADER (the group leader name).
  - Below that, I see a row of **member tabs** (e.g., "1. addfa asd ★", "2. saa ss", and a "+" to add members).
  - In the main content area I still see a placeholder text like:
    "Configuration forms for <member name>. Personal, Business, Financial, and Credit details will be configured here."

I need to REPLACE this placeholder with a real form.

## Goal

When the user opens Product Configuration for a proposal, they must be able to start filling the **loan details** for each member of the group.

We already have:
- Group ID and leader information.
- A list of members (from the proposal created earlier).
- A Proposals store that keeps proposals in memory / local storage.

Now we want:

1. A **Loan Details form** in the main content area.
2. The form must be **per member** – when I change the member tab, I see the fields for that member and the data is preserved.
3. All values must be stored in the existing proposal data structure, not lost on navigation.

## 1. Member tabs (keep them, reuse them)

- Keep the existing member tabs exactly as they are (the row with Member 1, Member 2, etc.).
- When the user clicks a member tab:
  - The Loan Details form below must show the data for that specific member.
  - Data must be preserved when switching between members.

Use the existing proposal/members structure to identify members (do NOT create a separate fake list).

## 2. Replace the placeholder with a Loan Details form

Inside the white card where the placeholder text currently appears:

- Add a title at the top-left: `Loan Details`.
- Below the title, create a form with generous spacing. Use a two-column layout when the screen is wide enough (tablet size):
  - Left column: first half of the fields.
  - Right column: the remaining fields.
- Use the existing Artemis styles (same input components, fonts, colors).

### Fields to implement

Use exactly these labels and behaviors:

1. **Loan Value** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Loan value ($)`
   - Type: numeric with currency formatting in US dollars.
   - Behavior:
     - Pre-fill with the member’s `Requested Amount` used earlier in the process (from the New Proposal screen).
     - Reuse the same currency mask behavior you already implemented for Requested Amount:
       - As the user types digits, format as money. For example:
         - typing `5` → `$0.05`
         - typing `555555` → `$5,555.55`
     - Keep the rule: maximum loan value is 50,000.
       - If the value is greater than 50,000, show an inline error under the field:
         `Maximum loan value is $50,000.00`
       - While this error is active, the form should be considered invalid.

2. **Loan Type** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Loan type`
   - Implementation: dropdown (select).
   - Options:
     - `Working capital`
     - `Investment`
     - `Other`

3. **Interest Rate** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Interest rate (%)`
   - Type: numeric.
   - Accept only numbers (and decimal).
   - Show an inline error if empty or not a valid number when the user tries to save.

4. **Number of Installments** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Number of installments`
   - Type: numeric (integer).
   - For now, enforce a range between 4 and 12.
   - If outside the range, show inline error:
     `Number of installments must be between 4 and 12`

5. **First Payment Date** (mandatory)
   - Label: `First payment date`
   - Type: date picker.
   - Default value logic:
     - Start from the current date.
     - Add 60 days (grace period).
     - Then set the default date to any day between the 1st and 15th of the following month.
   - The user should not be allowed to select a date BEFORE this minimum. If they do, show an inline error like:
     `First payment date must be after the grace period`

6. **Grace Period** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Grace period (days)`
   - Type: numeric.
   - Default value: `60`.
   - Accept only integers >= 0.
   - Show inline error if empty or negative.

7. **Loan Goal** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Loan goal`
   - Implementation: dropdown with these options:
     - `Inventory`
     - `Equipment`
     - `Working capital`
     - `Debt consolidation`
     - `Other`
   - If `Other` is selected, the `Other goal` field becomes more relevant (see below).

8. **Other Goal** (optional)
   - Label: `Other goal (optional)`
   - Type: text.
   - Optional — never block saving because of this field.
   - If `Loan goal` is `Other`, you can visually encourage filling it (e.g., placeholder text), but it must still remain optional.

9. **Borrower's Insurance** (mandatory)
   - Label: `Borrower's insurance`
   - Type: boolean (Yes/No).
   - Implementation: either radio buttons (`Yes` / `No`) or a toggle switch with clear labels.
   - Show an inline error if neither option is selected when the user tries to save.

10. **Optional Insurance 1** (optional)
    - Label: `Optional insurance 1`
    - Type: dropdown.
    - Options:
      - `None`
      - `Life coverage`
      - `Disability coverage`
      - `Job loss coverage`
    - Default to `None`.

11. **Optional Insurance 2** (optional)
    - Same as Optional insurance 1.

12. **Optional Insurance 3** (optional)
    - Same as Optional insurance 1.

### 3. Validation and saving

- All fields marked as mandatory above must be validated.
- DO NOT validate on every keystroke. Instead:
  - Validate on blur (when the user leaves a field) AND
  - Validate when the user clicks the main action button.

Currently there is a button **"Save & Exit"** at the top-right of the Product Configuration screen:

- Keep this button.
- Behavior:
  - When clicked:
    - Validate all mandatory fields for the **currently selected member**.
    - If there are validation errors, show inline errors under the affected fields and DO NOT navigate away.
    - If everything is valid:
      - Save all Loan Details values for the current member into the proposal’s data structure in the Proposals store.
      - Then navigate back to Home or the On Going proposals screen (use the same destination you already use when saving a proposal).

Important:
- The data for each member must be stored under that specific member in the Proposals store.
- When I leave Product Configuration and later click "Keep filling" from the On Going list, I should see the Loan Details form pre-populated with the previously saved values.

### 4. Do not remove existing behavior

- Do NOT remove:
  - The Group ID and Leader banner.
  - The member tabs.
  - The integration with the Proposals store.
  - The Save & Exit navigation target that is already working.
- Only replace the placeholder "Configuration forms for <member>" card with the Loan Details form described above, and wire it to the existing data structures.

Make sure all labels and inline error messages are in English and visually consistent with the rest of the Artemis Hunting MVP design.
