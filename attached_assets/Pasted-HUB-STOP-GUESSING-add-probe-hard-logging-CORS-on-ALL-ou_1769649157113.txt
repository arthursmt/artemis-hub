HUB - STOP GUESSING: add probe + hard logging + CORS on ALL outcomes

1) In server/routes.ts (or wherever Express routes are defined), add a global request logger ONLY for this path:
- Log every request to /api/proposals/submit (method, origin, referer).

2) Add a PROBE endpoint to confirm the deployed server is serving our code (not a fallback HTML page):
GET /api/debug/probe
Return JSON: { ok: true, service: "hub", ts: new Date().toISOString() }
Also set CORS headers on this response.

3) Ensure CORS headers are set for BOTH OPTIONS and POST for /api/proposals/submit.
For CORS, do NOT rely on a generic middleware that may skip errors/redirects.
Implement explicit handlers:

- OPTIONS /api/proposals/submit
  Return 204 and set:
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <request Origin>
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With, X-Correlation-Id
    Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Correlation-Id
    Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
    Vary: Origin

- POST /api/proposals/submit
  BEFORE forwarding anywhere:
    - Generate/propagate correlationId
    - Push a log entry into an in-memory ring buffer (last 50) with:
      { ts, correlationId, method, origin, referer, contentLength, received: true, forwarded: false }
    - Set CORS headers on the response (same as above, including Vary: Origin)
  Then forward to ARISE_BASE_URL + "/api/proposals/submit"
  Update the log entry with { forwarded: true, upstreamStatus, success }
  Return upstream status + JSON body.
  On ANY error, still return JSON with CORS headers and update log with error.

4) Update GET /api/debug/submit-last to return the ring buffer so we can see attempts even when upstream fails.

5) Republish HUB.

Validation checklist:
A) Open https://artemis-hub.replit.app/api/debug/probe -> MUST return JSON (not HTML).
B) Submit from the embedded Hunt.
C) Open https://artemis-hub.replit.app/api/debug/submit-last -> count MUST be > 0 and show origin/referer/correlationId.
